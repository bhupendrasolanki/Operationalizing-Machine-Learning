# Your Project Title Here

*TODO:* In the first project we had trained ML models using AutoML and Hyperdrive. This project was to deploy the best model from the run to create an endpoint. Also, how to consume the deployed endpoint and to test it. In this project we also had to create an AutoML pipeline and eployed it as well to create an endpoint. Swagger API's was also used in this project to test the endpoints.
